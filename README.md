# About

This repository contains the Ansible playbooks to reset a machine after a cohort ends.
The ansible scripts allows you to reset the machine to a clean state and ready for the next cohort.

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have connected to all devices in the network by SSH at least once. This is necessary to add the devices to the known hosts file.

```sh
ssh user@192.168.20.xxx
```

When prompted, type `yes` to add the device to the known hosts file, then exit the connection by typing `exit`.

Now you can proceed with the following steps.

## Install Ansible

1. Install [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

## Setup hosts `(inventory.ini)`

All computers should have a unique static IP address. This is necessary to
identify the machines in the network.

1. If `inventory.ini` is empty, create the file and populate it with the target machines. Use `inventory.ini.example` as a template.

```ini
[auckland]
; eda is the user name and 192.168.1.xxx is the IP address of the machine, where xxx is the unique number for the machine.
eda@192.168.1.xxx

[auckland:vars]
; populate the necessary variables here, such as ansible_user, ansible_ssh_pass, etc.
```

## SSH keys

This step is necessary to configure the ssh keys for github and `git iam` to work.

1. Generate new ssh keys by following the instructions from your wiki
2. Copy both files, `id_gh_daa` and `id_gh_daa.pub` to the `ssh-keys/` directory

## Ping the machines

1. Run the following command to ping all the machines in the inventory file.

```sh
ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping all
```

1. If all machines are reachable, you should see the following output in green
   and no red lines.

```sh
192.168.1.xxx | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

1. If all machines are reachable, move to the next step.

## Run Ansible Playbooks (METHOD 1)

### Update the Operating System and packages

In this step, we will update the operating system and install the necessary packages.

1. Run the following command

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini run-1.yml
```

1. Restart/Reboot all machines.

```sh
ansible all -m reboot -b i inventory.ini
```

1. Expect to see a lot of output in red, but then the output will turn yellow.
   This is normal.

At this point, the machines should have been updated and rebooted.

### Reset the machine

Here we will use the `run-2.yml` playbook to reset the machine to a clean state.

1. Run the following command

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini run-2.yml
```

NOTE: This playbook may fail at at a step where it tries to push the changes
to github. If this happens, go to github and confirm that the commit was made.

Press CTRL+C to stop the playbook and move to the next step.

### Chrome

This last playbook will setup the pinned bookmarks in chrome and it requires
you to go to each machine and do the following steps:

1. Open chrome and open a new tab.
1. Click on the `+` icon to create a new bookmark and enter any dummy name in
   the `Name` and `URL` fields.
1. Close the browser.
1. Repeat for all machines.
1. Run the last playbook to reset the pinned bookmarks.

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini run-3.yml
```

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰, the machines are now ready for the next cohort.

## Run Ansible Playbooks (METHOD 2)

### Creating a new account

If you need to create a new account, you can use the `new-account.yml` playbook.
This playbook will run all of the previous steps and create a new account.

This playbook creates a brand new account with the username defined in the
`inventory.ini` file. This way don't have to deal with clearing cookies, forms,
cache, or artifacts from the previous account.

1. Run the following command

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini new-account.yml
```
